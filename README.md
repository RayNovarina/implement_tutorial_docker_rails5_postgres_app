# README - AtomProjects/Dockerizing-Rails/NickJanetakis

Based on Dockerize a Rails 5, Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq and Action Cable
Application with Docker Compose tutorial at:
https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/dockerize-a-rails-5-postgres-redis-sidekiq-action-cable-app-with-docker-compose

This is a work in progress.

This is a successfull repo of getting the above tutorial to build a rails 5 app
in a local dev system in a Docker container and have it work via localhost.
I took the tutorial article and blended in my results and fixups. The file
Readme_app.txt is the result. I havent converted it to a .md format NOR does the
Heroku deploy section work yet.
